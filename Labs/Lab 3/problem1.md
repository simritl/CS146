1. 10000000000n^2 vs n^3:  
In this case n^3 is asymptotically greater because the exponential has a higher degree and will therefore will grow faster.

2. n^2log(n) vs n(log(n))^10:  
In this case n^2log(n) is asymptotically greater because it is polynomially greater and will therefore grow faster.

3. n^(logn) vs 2^(sqrt(n)):  
In this case n^2log(n) is asymptotically greater because it is polynomially greater and will therefore grow faster.

4. 2^n vs 2^(2n):  
In this case 2^(2n) is asymptotically greater because it is polynomially greater and will therefore grow faster.
