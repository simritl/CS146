1. Best Case:  
In the best case the for loop would only execute one time and the function will return false.  
So it would take O(1) time.

2. Worst Case:  
In the worst case the for loop would execute all the way up to sqrt(n).  
So it would take O(sqrt(n)) time.

3. Average Case:  
In an average case the it would also take O(sqrt(n)) time.
