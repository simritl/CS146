Iterate through the array using a for loop starting from the element at index 0 to the second last element.   
Then with a nested for loop iterate through the array starting at the element at index i + 1 to the last element.  
Check if the sum of the two elements at indices i and j is equal to the target.  
If it is equal to the target return the indices of the two elements otherwise return an empty array.
