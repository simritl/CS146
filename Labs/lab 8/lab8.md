I used a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. First, I made an array to store the min number of coins that are needed to make up each amount. Then set all the valyes in the array to 0. Then iterate for each amount from 1 to the amount, then for each amount set the min to a higher value than the maximum value in the array. Then iterate over each coin amount in the array and figure the remaining amount you need for i minus the coin at j. If the remaining amount is not negative then find the temp which is the number of coins that are still needed to make up the current i. Update the min and also temp. After iterating over all the coins, if the min is still equal to the initialized one and no combination was found then set the amount to -1 otherwise min. Then return amount.
