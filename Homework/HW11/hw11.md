I implemented this using recursion and depth first search.  
First I checked if the image was null or empty or just not meeting the requirements. If it is then just return the image.  
Then check if the image is already the new color then return the image.  
Then I made a helper method which first checks if the position is out of bounds and if it is not then it changes the color to the new color and it will recursivley call itself for the positions up, down, left, and right from the current one.  
Then once done it will print the modified image.
