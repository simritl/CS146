For this problem I used Dijkstra’s algorithm. First I made a graph that is n+1 by n+1 and filled all the edges with a large value except for the edges that make a self loop. Then I iterate over the array of pipes and add the costs of connecting the pipes to the graph and also iterate through the wells and also add those costs to the graph. Then I used Dijkstra’s to find the least cost to connect all the houses to water and to keep track of everything there is a visited array and min cost array. Then just go and iterate through all the nodes for all the nodes and find the node with the minimum cost from the source, mark it as visited and update the minimum cost if it is. Then add up all the minimum costs and return them.
