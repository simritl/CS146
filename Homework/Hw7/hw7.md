First initiliaze two new arrays that are the same size as the length of intervals.  
Then interate through each element in the 2d array intervals and put all the start times into one array and end times into the other array.  
Then sort the two arrays.  
Next using the for loop iterate through all the start times and if the start time is less than the end time index increment the server count which means that a new room will be needed else increment the end time index which means it should move on to the next end time.  
Then return the number of rooms needed.
