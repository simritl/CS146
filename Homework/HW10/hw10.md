First I made an array list to store the results of the level order.  
Then check if the root is null, and if it is, then return the empty array list.  
Then I created a linked list queue to do bfs and that will store the nodes that are visited and add the root to it to start.  
While the queue is not empty, get the size of the queue and create another list to store the node values.  
Then iterate from zero to the size of the queue and dequeue each node and add the value to the level list, then enque the children of that node if they exist.  
Then add the level list to the result list and return it.
